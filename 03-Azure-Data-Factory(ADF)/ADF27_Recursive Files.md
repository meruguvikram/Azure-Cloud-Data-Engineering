## How to create pipeline to get files recursively as per above screen shots.



Create **Parameters** outside the pipeline as per below screen shot.

Drag **GetMetadata** Activity into **Pipeline** and name it as **getBaseInsideFolders**

Create **dataset** and name it as **ds_rec**

Open dataset and create one parameter as Per below image

Now go to dataset **settings** and pass the **parameter** in **dataset properties** **Value**

Click on **Value** then it will take you to **Pipeline expression Builder**

In pipeline expression builder click on Parameters tab below and select **pBasePath** Parameter (which we created outside pipeline) as per below image
